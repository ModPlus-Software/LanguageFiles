    <instruction1>All rooms in the project must have the shared parameters specified in this list. You can use your own shared parameters of the same type (specified in parentheses). Specify your own shared parameters in the list or click the "Create missing parameters" button. All numeric parameters are represented by the "Currency" type, which allows to process rooms in groups</instruction1>
    <instruction1_1>Additional parameters are processed and filled only if the rooms have these parameters. You can use your own shared parameters of the same type (specified in parentheses). Specify your own shared parameters in the list or click the "Create missing parameters" button</instruction1_1>
    <instruction2>In the room matrix the basic properties for the selection of the processed rooms, the numbering of rooms in the apartment, as well as the values for the calculation of the apartment areas are set. The values from the matrix are selected by matching the functional purpose (FN column) and the room name. In the "Room name" column you can specify an asterisk at the end of the name, which will indicate a check for a match at the beginning of the room name (for example, the value "Bedroom*" will match the room names "Bedroom 1", "Bedroom 2", etc.)</instruction2>
    <!-- todo remove after 2.11.15.0 -->
    <instruction2_1>This table specifies the data used to define the apartment type. The values "Contains rooms" and " Not contains rooms" are filled in with the names of rooms, separated by semicolons (;)</instruction2_1>
    <instruction2_2>The list specifies mapping of floors and typical floors. If a typical floor is specified for a floor, then when collecting and calculating apartments, all parameters of rooms located on the specified floor will be taken from the corresponding room located on the typical floor. The room of a typical floor is defined by a vertical ray passed through the insertion point of the processed room. Floors can be defined both by level names and by level elevations</instruction2_2>
    <instruction2_3>This table specifies the data used to define the type of apartment. The conditions "Contains rooms" and "Does not contain rooms" are filled with room names separated by semicolons (;). It is possible to complete the room names with a condition to check the area and/or a condition to check that the room is a mezzanine. To do this, enter the condition and the area value in brackets after the room name and/or comma separated condition to check if the room is a mezzanine, if necessary. The available conditions are equal (=), not equal (!=), greater than (&gt;), greater than or equal to (&gt;=), less than (&lt;), less than or equal to (&lt;=). For the "Mezzanine" check, add a comma separated "m" to set the condition "The room must be a mezzanine" or "nm" to set the condition "The room must not be a mezzanine". You can set the condition to only check "Mezzanine" without checking the area. Examples: "Kitchen (&gt;10); Bedroom", "Pantry (&lt;5,m)", "Pantry (nm)"</instruction2_3>
    <instruction3>The initial check includes two parts: a check for unplaced rooms and a check for the occupancy of the parameters "Functional purpose" and "Name". If the value of the "Functional purpose" parameter corresponds to the value of the "Apartment Identifier" specified in the settings, then the "Name" parameter will be checked against the current room matrix</instruction3>
    <instruction4>The apartments are collected through the geometric characteristics of the rooms, taking into account the connection of the rooms through windows, doors and room separators. All rooms of the same apartment are assigned the same value of the "Apartment ID" parameter. It is recommended to perform an additional visual check by creating a color scheme according to the "Apartment ID" parameter</instruction4>
    <instruction5>Apartment calculation includes calculating the areas of the apartment, the number of living rooms, as well as determining the type of apartment using the "Apartment types" source. All obtained values are assigned to the parameters of the rooms included in the apartment. All apartments are defined according to the value of the "Apartment ID" parameter set at the "Collect apartments" step</instruction5>
    <instruction5_1>This tab is not part of the main Apartment Typology algorithm! It is intended solely for filling the "AP_Rounded area" parameter (or the corresponding one in use) in selected rooms based on rounding settings. Use this feature only for rooms that do not match the current Functional purpose</instruction5_1>
    <instruction6>Numbering can be done by grouping the apartments by Housings and/or Sections by enabling the corresponding options and by specifying the parameter names from which to take the value of the Housing and/or Sections. In this case, it is considered that the sections are subgroups for the housings. The "End-to-end numbering" property means that the numbering in the next group will continue, not start from the value set in the "Initial number" property. If you select the " Point " option in the "Start of numbering" property, you will need to select a room for each group of apartments</instruction6>
    <!-- todo remove after 2.11.15.0 -->
    <instruction7>Creating apartment views is done by duplicating the current view, followed by cropping along the contour of the apartment. First of all, an attempt is made to create a crop contour considering the thickness of the enclosing walls (only for Revit 2020 and higher). If unsuccessful, an attempt is made to create a crop contour taking into account the thickest of the enclosing walls. If the crop contour is not created, the apartment contour obtained from the room boundaries will be used. If the option "Try to use apartment type as view name" is enabled, the created views will be given a name of the type "LEVEL_NAME – Apartment APARTMENT_TYPE".</instruction7>
    <!-- todo remove after 2.11.15.0 -->
    <instruction8>The apartment editor allows you to make manual changes to the values of the apartment areas, as well as to merge multilevel apartments. When merging multilevel apartments, the areas are recalculated and the value of the "AP_Levels count" parameter is filled in. IMPORTANT: When recalculating apartments on a particular level, the parameter values of rooms belonging to the multilevel apartment, but located on another level, will not be recalculated</instruction8>
    <instruction8_1>Apartments are collected regardless of the current value of the apartment identifier specified in the settings. The apartment editor allows you to make changes to the values of apartment areas, as well as to build multilevel apartments. When building multilevel apartments, the areas are recalculated and the value of the "AP_Levels count" parameter is filled in. The apartment editor also allows you to recalculate selected apartments, lock or unlock selected apartments, and delete selected apartments</instruction8_1>
    <!-- todo remove after 2.11.15.0 -->
    <instruction9>Locked apartments are apartments whose rooms will not be processed when collecting apartments. Apartments are locked on the "Collecting apartments" tab. Locked apartments are displayed in the list regardless of the current value of the "Apartment Identifier" (value of the "Functional purpose" parameter)</instruction9>
    <instruction9_1>Locked apartments are apartments whose rooms will not be processed when collecting and calculating apartments. Locked apartments are displayed in the list regardless of the current value of the "Flats Identifier" (value of the "Functional Purpose" parameter)</instruction9_1>
    <instruction10>Classification allows you to fill in certain parameters of apartments based on the characteristics of the apartments. First, you need to create tables with conditions on the "Conditions" tab, after which you can perform classification with the result displayed on the "Classification" tab</instruction10>
    <instruction10_1>Specify the target parameter - string parameter to which the classification result will be set. The area is checked by the specified parameter of a random room of the apartment (i.e. all rooms are considered to have the same parameter value). The conditions "Contains rooms" and "Does not contain rooms" are filled with room names separated by semicolon (;). The room names can be completed with a condition to check the area and/or a condition to check that the room is a mezzanine. To do this, enter the condition and the area value in brackets after the room name and/or the condition for checking "Mezzanine" after the comma, if necessary. The available conditions are equal (=), not equal (!=), greater than (&gt;), greater than or equal to (&gt;=), less than (&lt;), less than or equal to (&lt;=). For the "Mezzanine" check, add a comma separated "m" to set the condition "The room must be a mezzanine" or "nm" to set the condition "The room must not be a mezzanine". You can set the condition to only check "Mezzanine" without checking the area. Examples: "Kitchen (&gt;10); Bedroom", "Pantry (&lt;5,m)", "Pantry (nm)"</instruction10_1>
    <instruction10_2>Classification is performed according to the specified condition tables from the Conditions tab. If the apartment to be checked does not fall under any row of the table conditions, the target parameter will be cleared</instruction10_2>
