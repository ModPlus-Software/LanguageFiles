    <t44>α is a coefficient that takes into account the effect on the anchoring length of the stress state of concrete and reinforcement and the structural solution of the element in the anchoring zone. When anchoring rods of a periodic profile with straight ends (straight anchoring) or smooth reinforcement with hooks or loops without additional anchoring devices for stretched rods, take α = 1.0, and for compressed ones – α = 0.75. According to clause 10.3.30 of SP 63.13330, the coefficient α may be increased to 2.0</t44>
    <t45>According to paragraph 10.3.8 of SP 63.13330.2012, the vertical bars take no more than 2t and 400 mm (t is the thickness of the wall)</t45>
    <t46>In accordance with GOST 21.501-2018, clause 6.4.7, the length of the detail is set along the outer edge of the rebar</t46>

    <t59>When you turn on the "Breaking in" option, each first pair of joints along the wall will be created with the first overlap length, every second pair – with the second overlap length</t59>
    <t60>If the joints exceed the height of the overlying wall, they will be cut off along the upper face of the wall, taking into account the specified ends cover of the rebars</t60>

    <t69>If the horizontal bars of the background reinforcement are on the inside and the vertical bars are on the outside, it is recommended to specify the girth of the vertical bars.

    <t44>α is a coefficient that takes into account the effect on the anchoring length of the stress state of concrete and reinforcement and the structural solution of the element in the anchoring zone. When anchoring rods of a periodic profile with straight ends (straight anchoring) or smooth reinforcement with hooks or loops without additional anchoring devices for stretched rods, take α = 1.0, and for compressed ones – α = 0.75. According to clause 10.3.30 of SP 63.13330, the coefficient α may be increased to 2.0</t44>
