    <t43>Attention! The surface appearance of the reinforcement may depend on the class of reinforcement, diameter or other values that are not considered by the program. Read the normative documentation</t43>
    <t44>α is a coefficient that takes into account the effect on the anchoring length of the stress state of concrete and reinforcement and the structural solution of the element in the anchoring zone. When anchoring rods of a periodic profile with straight ends (straight anchoring) or smooth reinforcement with hooks or loops without additional anchoring devices for stretched rods, take α = 1.0, and for compressed ones – α = 0.75. According to clause 10.3.30 of SP 63.13330, the coefficient α may be increased to 2.0</t44>
    <t45>According to paragraph 10.3.8 of SP 63.13330.2012, the vertical bars take no more than 2t and 400 mm (t is the thickness of the wall)</t45>
    <t46>In accordance with GOST 21.501-2018, clause 6.4.7, the length of the detail is set along the outer edge of the rebar</t46>

    <t58>Rebar length consists of two anchoring lengths</t58>
    <t59>When you turn on the "Breaking in" option, each first pair of joints along the wall will be created with the first overlap length, every second pair – with the second overlap length</t59>
    <t60>If the joints exceed the height of the overlying wall, they will be cut off along the upper face of the wall, taking into account the specified ends cover of the rebars</t60>
    <t61>The selection variant applies to the selection of plates</t61>
    <t62>The vertical rebar is moved to the place where the U-shaped rebar bend begins, which is obtained by adding the values of the cover layer of the horizontal reinforcement from the ends, the diameter of the U-shaped rebar and the standard bending diameter of the U-shaped rebar</t62>

    <t69>If the horizontal bars of the background reinforcement are on the inside and the vertical bars are on the outside, it is recommended to specify the girth of the vertical bars. For the opposite case, when the horizontal bars of the background reinforcement are located outside, it is recommended to specify the girth of the horizontal bars</t69>
    <t70>The length of the detail is taken as the length of the anchoring</t70>
    <t71>Each second pair of rods will be indented at the bottom by a distance equal to the absolute value of the overlap length difference. The indentation does not affect the second overlap length. For example, if the first overlap length is 500 mm and the second overlap length is 750 mm, then the rods of each second pair will be indented from below 250 mm</t71>

    <t43>Attention! The surface appearance of the reinforcement may depend on the class of reinforcement, diameter or other values that are not considered by the program. Read the normative documentation</t43>
    <t44>α is a coefficient that takes into account the effect on the anchoring length of the stress state of concrete and reinforcement and the structural solution of the element in the anchoring zone. When anchoring rods of a periodic profile with straight ends (straight anchoring) or smooth reinforcement with hooks or loops without additional anchoring devices for stretched rods, take α = 1.0, and for compressed ones – α = 0.75. According to clause 10.3.30 of SP 63.13330, the coefficient α may be increased to 2.0</t44>
